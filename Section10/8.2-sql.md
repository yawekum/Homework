<br>
<br>
<br>

# Directions for Today's Self Guided SQL Cleaning Tour
 1. You will be tasked with cleaning a dataset using SQL statements and queries
 2. Follow the instructions of each section
 3. Please record all of your queries and Statements in a Markdown file for submission for Week 8 HW. 
 4. You will have all of 8.2 class to work through the assignment and whatever you have left at the end of class will become this week's SQL HW 


<br>

# TABLE set-up for Tonight's Lab 
1. Please open up DBrowser for SQLite. 
2. Open a New DATABASE and name the DATABASE "SQLCleaningLab"
3. Import the csv file called "SavvyCoders_SQL_CleaningLab.csv" from section 08 resources
4. Name the table `evCars'
5. In the pop up window: Make sure that your field separator is a comma and your quote character is a single quote. 
6. In the pop up window: Glance over the data and make sure it looks correct (data in row/column format)
7. Open up the advanced menu and select the option to "disable data type selection"
8. Press okay to import the table. 

<br>

 ### First look at our table `evCars` after importing the table

# Section 1

- If you look at the column `Accel` you can see that each value has the ' sec' suffix on the value. 
- This creates an issue becasue if you ever wanted to run a summary function like AVG() on the `Accel` values you would not be able to becasue the datatype would most likely be a string and not an acceptable type to run that function. 
- Our Job is to remove that suffix from the `Accel` column. We are also going to rename the column with the units in the column name to inform the person looking at the table what the column units are. 
<br>

### - 1.1 Review the column that you are looking to change
<br>

```SQL

SELECT Accel
FROM evCars
```
<br>

### - 1.2 Selecting the correct string function

- We would like to remove ' sec'  from each value in the `Accel` column. 
- Choose the appropriate string function from the string function list. There may be more then one way to accomplish this task. 
- Please place your queries in a .md file for review. Whatever you do not finish is considered HW. 
<br>

```SQL

RTRIM (Accel, 'sec')

```
<br>

### - 1.3 Visualizing the changes before making them 

- Use a select statement to visualize the original column and the changes that are made by the string function side by side in the result set. 
- Also take note of how many rows are returned in this select statement. (you can use the rowid on the far left of the result set---> scroll to the bottom number)
- You will use this number to confirm you are changing the correct amount of rows in the next step. 
<br>

```SQL
SELECT Accel, RTRIM(Accel, 'sec')
FROM evCars

```

<br>

### - 1.4 UPDATE the records 

- Write the update statement to set `Accel` to equal the return value of the string function that you chose to use in 1.2.

<br>

```SQL

UPDATE evCars 
SET Accel = RTRIM(Accel, 'sec')

```


<br>

### - 1.5 Check your work
- It is good practice to check over the rows that you changed. Write a select statement to look at the column again. (you can reuse the code you wrote above)
<br>

```SQL

SELECT Accel
FROM evCars

```

<br>

### - 1.6 Rename the column
 - Rename the `Accel` column to `accelSec`
 <br>

```SQL
ALTER TABLE evCars
RENAME Accel to AccelSec
```


<br>

# Section 2

- We are going to go through basically the same process in Section 1 but for each of the following columns:
    ```SQL
    SELECT TopSpeed, Range, efficiency, FastCharge
    FROM evCars
    LIMIT 10
    ```

- I will outline `Topspeed` in section 2. After this section you will be instructed to do `Range`, `efficiency`, and `FastCharge`. 
- Rememeber please place your answers and queries in a .md file for review. 
<br>


### - 2.1 Review the column that you are looking to change 
- Write a query to look at all the records in the `Topspeed` column.  
<br>

```SQL

SELECT TopSpeed
FROM evCars

```


<br>

### - 2.2 Selecting the correct String Function

- We would like to remove 'km/h' from each value in the column `TopSpeed`. 
- Choose the appropriate string function from the string function list. There may be more then one way to accomplish this task.  

```SQL

RTRIM(TopSpeed, 'km/h')

```


### - 2.3 Visualizing the Changes before making them 

- Use a select statement to visualize the original column, `TopSpeed` and the changes that are made by the string function side by side in the result set. 
- Take note of how many rows are returned in this SELECT statement. You will use this number to confirm you are changing the correct amount of rows later. 

```SQL
SELECT TopSpeed, RTRIM(TopSpeed, 'km/h')
FROM evCars

```


### - 2.4 UPDATE the records

- Write the update statement to set `TopSpeed` to equal the return value of the string function you chose in 2.2
<br>

```SQL

UPDATE evCars
SET TopSpeed = RTRIM(TopSpeed, 'km/h')

```


### - 2.5 Check your work 
- Write a select statement to look at the column again. (you can reuse the code you wrote above in 2.1)
<br>

```SQL

SELECT TopSpeed
FROM evCars

```


### - 2.6 Convert the units to MPH
- Let's convert the `TopSpeed` from km/h to MPH
- Write a select statement to multiply the speed by 0.621371. Return  original `Topspeed` and calculated `TopspeedMPH`. Round the answer to 1 decimal place . 

```SQL
SELECT TopSpeed, ROUND(TopSpeed*0.621371, 1)
FROM evCars
```
- Write and executing the above query to see the original and the converted value side by side
- Turn this query into an UPDATE statement

```SQL

UPDATE evCars
SET TopSpeed = ROUND(TopSpeed*0.621371, 1)

```
- use your query from 2.5 to check the column to make sure the changes are what yoiu expected. 

### - 2.7 Rename the column
 - Rename the `TopSpeed` column to `topSpeedMPH`
 <br>

```SQL
ALTER TABLE evCars
RENAME TopSpeed TO topSpeedMPH

```
<br>

### - 2.8  Select All of the records to get a look at the whole table with your recent changes. 
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM evCars
```

# Section 3 

- We are going to go through basically the same process in Section 2 but `Range`. We will continue with `efficiency`, and `FastCharge` in the following sections. 
- For these sections there will be less help spelled out for you. 
- Rememeber please place your answers and queries in a .md file for review. 
### - 3.1 Review the column that you are looking to change 
```SQL
SELECT *
FROM evCars
```
### - 3.2 Selecting the correct String Function
- We would like to remove 'km' from each value in the column `Range`. 
- Choose the appropriate string function from the string function list. There may be more then one way to accomplish this task. 
```SQL
Range = RTRIM (Range, 'km')
```

### - 3.3 Visualizing the Changes before making them 

- Use a select statement to visualize the original column, `Range` and the changes that are made by the string function side by side in the result set. 
- Take note of how many rows are returned in this SELECT statement. You will use this number to confirm you are changing the correct amount of rows later. 
```SQL
SELECT Range,  RTRIM (Range, 'km')
FROM evCars
```

### - 3.4 UPDATE the records

- Write the update statement to set `Range` to equal the return value of the string function you chose in 3.2
 ```SQL
UPDATE evCars
SET Range = RTRIM (Range, 'km')
```
<br>

### - 3.5 Check your work 
- Write a select statement to look at the column again. (you can reuse the code you wrote above)
```SQL
SELECT Range
FROM evCars
```
<br>

### - 3.6 Convert the units to MPH
- Let's convert the `Range` from km to miles. 
- Write a select statement to multiply the distance by 0.621371. Return original `Range` and calculated `RangeMiles`. Round the answer to 1 decimal place.
- After writing and executing the above query to see the original and the converted values, review them side by side and if satisfied then move to the next step
- Turn this query into an UPDATE statement. 
- Use your query from 3.5 to check the column 
<br>

```SQL
SELECT Range, ROUND(Range*0.621371, 1)
FROM evCars

UPDATE evCars
SET Range = ROUND(Range*0.621371, 1)

```

### - 3.7 Rename the column
 - Rename the `Range` column to `rangeMiles`
 <br>

 ```SQL
ALTER TABLE evCars
RENAME Range TO rangeMiles
```

# SECTION 4 

- We are going to go through basically the same process as section 1-3 but we are going to work on `efficiency` and `FastCharge` at the same time. 
- Rememeber please place your answers and queries in a .md file for review. 
### - 4.1 Write a select statement to review both of the columns that you are looking to change 

```SQL
SELECT Efficiency, FastCharge
FROM evCars
```
### - 4.2 Selecting the correct String Function that we need to remove for each column.
- We would like to remove ' Wh/km' from each value in the column `efficiency`. 
- We would like to remove ' km/h from `FastCharge`
- Choose the appropriate string function from the string function list. There may be more then one way to accomplish this task. 

```SQL
RTRIM(Efficiency, 'Wh/km')


RTRIM(FastCharge, 'km/h')

```

### - 4.3 Visualizing the Changes before making them 

- Use a select statement to visualize the original column `efficiency`, the string function removing ' Wh/km', original column  `Fastcharge`, and the string function removing ' km/h'
- Take note of how many rows are returned in this SELECT statement. You will use this number to confirm you are changing the correct amount of rows later. 

```SQL
SELECT Efficiency, RTRIM(Efficiency, 'Wh/km')
FROM evCars

SELECT FastCharge, RTRIM(FastCharge, 'km/h')
FROM evCars
```

### - 4.4 UPDATE the records

- Write the update statement to set `Range` to equal the return value of the string function you chose in 4.2
- use this for help: 

```SQL
UPDATE evCars
SET
Efficiency = RTRIM(Efficiency, 'Wh/km'), 
FastCharge = RTRIM(FastCharge, 'km/h')
``` 
<br>

### - 4.5 Check your work 
- Write a select statement to look at all of the columns again. (you can reuse the code you wrote above in section4.3)
<br>

```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM evCars
```

### - 4.6 Convert the `FastCharge` units to MPH
- Let's convert the `FastCharge` from km to miles. 
- Write a select statement to multiply the distance by 0.621371. Return original `FastCharge` and calculated `OneHourFastChargeMiles`. Round the answer to 1 decimal place.
- After writing and executing the above query to see the original and the converted values, review them side by side and if satisfied then move to the next step
- Turn this query into an UPDATE statement. 
- Use your query from 4.5 to check the column 
<br>

```SQL
UPDATE evCars
SET FastCharge = ROUND(FastCharge*0.621371, 1)
```

### - 4.7 Rename the column
 - Write two seperate ALTER TABLE statements for these. 
 - Rename the `FastCharge` column to `OneHourFastChargeMiles`
 - Rename the `efficiency` column to `efficiencyWHperKM`
 <br>

```SQL
ALTER TABLE evCars
RENAME FastCharge TO OneHourFastChargeMiles

ALTER TABLE evCars
RENAME Efficiency TO efficiencyWHperKM
```

# SECTION 5 
<br>

### - 5.1 Working with `RapidCharge`
- Write a query that selects `RapidCharge` and counts all the records based on that attribute. (HINT: Remember GROUP BY from SQL Lesson 7.2)
- Take note of the counts for each unique attriute. You should use this to make sure that you are changing the correct number of rows with your update statement. 

```SQL
SELECT RapidCharge, COUNT(*)
FROM evCars
GROUP BY RapidCharge
```
### - 5.2 making data cleaning choices 
- This attribute or column designates if the car had Rapid charging capability. 
- we are going to simplify the records 
    - this can be done in a few different ways
        1. you can make the values a boolean: either True or False
        2. you can make the values a 1 for yes they are rapid charge capable or a 0 for no they are not capable. 
        3. or you can do a yes or no. 
<br>

```SQL
UPDATE evCars
SET RapidCharge = 1
WHERE RapidCharge = 'Rapid charging possible'

UPDATE evCars
SET RapidCharge = 0
WHERE RapidCharge = 'Rapid charging not possible'
```

### - 5.3 Please fill in the blank on your .md answer sheet
- For the purpose of this exercise, if the car's `RapidCharge` value equals 1 then I want you to change the value to 'Yes' 
- If the `RapidCharge` value equals 0 then I want you to change the value to 'No'. 
<br>

```SQL
UPDATE evCars
SET RapidCharge = 'Yes'
WHERE RapidCharge = 1

UPDATE evCars
SET RapidCharge = 'No'
WHERE RapidCharge = 0
```
### - 5.2 Writing the update Statements  
- use this syntax reminder to help guide your update statement writing
- you are going to write two update statements, one for each of the conditions described above. 
<br>


```SQL
UPDATE tablename
SET Columnname = string 
WHERE Condition 

```
<br>

# Table Update

<p><br></p>

# SECTION 6 
### -6.1 Visualize the `Powertrain` records
- Write a query that selects `PowerTrain` and counts all the records. (HINT: Remember GROUP BY from SQL Lesson 7.2)
- Take note of the counts for each unique attriute. You should use this to make sure that you are changing the correct number of rows with your update statement. 
<br>

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT PowerTrain, COUNT(*)
FROM evCars
GROUP BY PowerTrain
```

### - 6.2 Please fill in the blank on your .md answer sheet
- look at the three DISTINCT values from the query you wrote in 6.1 and fill in the blanks.
- If the PowerTrain equals All Wheel Drive then I want you to change the value to 'AWD'
- If the PowerTrain equals Rear Wheel Drive then I want you to change the value to 'RWD'
- If the PowerTrain equals Front Wheel Drive then I want you to change the value to 'FWD'
<br>

### - 6.3 Write three update statements for the three different conditions 

```SQL
UPDATE evCars
SET PowerTrain = 'AWD'
WHERE PowerTrain = 'All Wheel Drive'

UPDATE evCars
SET PowerTrain = 'FWD'
WHERE PowerTrain = 'Front Wheel Drive'

UPDATE evCars
SET PowerTrain = 'RWD'
WHERE PowerTrain = 'Rear Wheel Drive'
```
### - 6.4 Write a query to Select all of the records to view your changes. 

```SQL
SELECT * 
FROM evCars
```
<br>

# Table Update

<p><br></p>

# SECTION 7 

### - 7.1 Convert the `PriceEuro` to `PriceUSD` 
- Let's convert the `PriceEuro` into US Dollar  
- Write a select statement to multiply the `PriceEuro` by 1.09 and Return `PriceEuro` and calculated column. Round the calculated column to 2 decimal places. 
- After writing and executing the above query to see the original and the converted values, review them side by side and if satisfied then move to the next step

```SQL
SELECT PriceEuro, ROUND(PriceEuro*1.09, 2)
FROM evCars
```

### - 7.2 Write the Update Statements 
- Turn this query into an UPDATE statement. Remember to round the calculation to two decimal points. 
- Write a select query from to check the PriceEuro column 

```SQL
UPDATE evCars
SET PriceEuro = ROUND(PriceEuro*1.09, 2)

SELECT PriceEuro
FROM evCars
```
### - 7.3 Rename the Column
- Rename `PriceEuro to PriceUSD`
<br>

```SQL
ALTER TABLE evCars
RENAME PriceEuro TO PriceUSD
```
